# Euler-Problems

A simple Express project to view and run solutions to the project Euler exercises.

Run the node file under `bin/www` to launch the project.

Each solution is housed in it's own JS file under the `/public/javascripts/euler` folder.

Solutions all use vanilla javacript (ES6 syntax).
