# Euler-Problems

A simple Express project to view and run solutions to the project Euler exercises.

Run the node file under `bin/www` to launch the project.

Each solution is housed in it's own JS file under the `/public/javascripts/euler` folder.

Solutions all use vanilla javacript (ES6 syntax). 

All were solutions tested on the latest version of the Chrome browser. (not all features from the ES6 syntax will work on other browsers)
